# Matching Animals

The game taken inspiration from Onet Connect and related childhood games in 2003.

# Game Rules

In the game, you draw a line between them. However there are some very important rules you need to follow:

- There can’t be any obstacles in the way between two similar tiles.

- The line that connects two tiles can change direction only twice. (Or less, of course).

- There is a total of 5 levels and time estimation of 3 minutes, but you don't have to worry as subtle hints will help you along the journey. 

# How to install

1. Extract the file "matching-animals-v0.x.0-xx.rar" (x is changeable version number)
